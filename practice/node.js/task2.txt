TASK: Develop a node.js server that implements express, and a python client with the following behavior

The client should be able to POST a message to the server

The client should also be able to GET the last message that was sent to the server

Here's the catch: if the client sends a message to the server, then the server is completely stopped 
(with crtl+c), and then the server is restarted, if the client then send a GET request for the last 
message sent, the server should still return the last message that was posted to the server before 
shutdown. For example:

1. Client sends POST request with message "Hello!" to the server
2. Server is stopped with crtl+c
3. Server is started again in terminal
4. Client sends GET request to the server, and "Hello!" is returned to the client by the server
