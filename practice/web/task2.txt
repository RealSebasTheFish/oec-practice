TASK: Develop a calculator that include basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. Allow the operations to be buttons, and the numbers to be inputted through a text field. The output 
should be displayed in an HTML element too. The styling is up to you, but attempt to keep it as user friendly 
as possible.
